This project is part of my final for ENVS 193DS: Advanced Data Visualization at UCSB. Over a few months, I tracked my daily reading habits — including where I read, how long I read for, how many pages I got through, and how I felt during each session. This infographic is my way of visualizing those patterns and seeing what kinds of environments or habits worked best for me.


What's in the Infographic
I created four visualizations in R to explore my data:

Boxplot with Jitter – compares mood across different reading environments

Grouped Bar Chart – shows how often I read in each setting and the average mood there

Scatter Plot – looks at the relationship between time spent reading and pages read

Mood Strip Plot – inspired by Ellie Highwood’s climate blanket; shows mood over time using color tiles

All of the figures were made in R and then put together into a final infographic using Canva.
