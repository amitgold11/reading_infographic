```{r setup}
# Load required libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(here)

# Read in dataset
reading_data <- read_csv(here("data", "updated_reading_dataset.csv"))
```

### Plot 1: Mood by Environment (Boxplot + Jitter)
```{r boxplot-jitter}
# Plot 1: Mood by Reading Environment
ggplot(reading_data, aes(x = Environment, y = Mood, fill = Environment)) +
  geom_boxplot(show.legend = FALSE, alpha = 0.6, outlier.shape = NA) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.2, color = "black", alpha = 0.5, size = 2) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set2") +
  labs(
    title = "Mood While Reading by Environment",
    subtitle = "Quieter settings correlate with higher mood",
    x = "Reading Environment",
    y = "Mood Rating (1 = low, 5 = high)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 13) +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = 16),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12)
  )
```
Mood ratings were highest in quiet environments like libraries and quiet cafes. Noisier spaces tended to lower my reading mood.


### Plot 2: Pages Read by Environment and Time of Day (Grouped Bar Plot)
```{r bar-plot}
# Summarize total pages read by environment and time of day
pages_by_env_time <- reading_data %>%
  group_by(Environment, `Time of Day`) %>%
  summarize(Total_Pages = sum(`Pages Read`, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop")

# Create grouped bar plot
ggplot(pages_by_env_time, aes(x = Environment, y = Total_Pages, fill = `Time of Day`)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Pastel1") +
  labs(
    title = "When and Where I Read the Most",
    subtitle = "Grouped by Environment and Time of Day",
    x = "Reading Environment",
    y = "Total Pages Read",
    fill = "Time of Day"
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 13) +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = 16),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12)
  )
```
I read the most in libraries during the afternoon. Quiet settings and daytime hours support better focus and page count.
